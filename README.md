## What Is This?

The Colony is a **desktop web app** where you build and manage a hierarchy of AI agents — each backed by a real LLM (Claude, GPT-4o, or Gemini). It's part colony simulation, part AI orchestration platform, part HR management system.

You are **Employee #0001 — the Founder**. Everything flows through you.

When you dispatch a mission, it routes to your **Sr. Executive**, who decomposes it into department-level tasks and delegates to managers. Managers delegate to workers. Results bubble back up. The whole chain runs autonomously, in real time, with a live audit log.

Meanwhile, your **L&D department head runs on autopilot** — reviewing every agent's performance daily, updating skills, creating training plans, and reporting back to you.

Think: **Rimworld meets a real AI agent framework**.

## Features

### 🤖 Real AI Agents, Real Hierarchy
- **Founder → Sr. Executive → Managers → Workers** — strict chain of command
- Each agent is backed by a live LLM: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, or Gemini 1.5 Pro
- Agents have names, personalities, employee IDs, and persistent memory across missions
- Routing is fully automated — you talk to the Executive, the Executive talks to the managers

### 🗺️ Rimworld-Inspired Colony Map
- Pixi.js canvas renders every agent as an **ID card tile** — employee ID, name, role, status dot
- Department zones with corner markers and color-coded glows
- Live animations: idle agents breathe, working agents pulse, training agents shimmer pink
- Click any tile → opens the full **Colonist ID Dossier**

### 📋 Colonist ID Cards
- Full Rimworld-style dossier panel: mugshot frame with height ruler, barcode, `"SURVIVAL IS OUR ONLY LAW."` footer
- Shows skills, strike history, commendations, org structure, psychological profile
- Grain texture overlay, amber/tan accent, everything uppercase — straight from the reference

### 🎯 Mission Control — Slack-Style Command Channel
- **Slack-style message feed** — consecutive messages from the same agent are grouped, avatars only appear on the first message
- **Tier-colored avatars** — executive, manager, worker each have distinct colors at a glance
- **Live streaming** — executive and manager responses appear token-by-token with a blinking cursor
- **Formal Report Cards** — final compiled reports render as expandable cards with full markdown, not raw text
- Delegation notes show exactly which task each manager was assigned

- Send training resources, feedback, links, or directives directly to your L&D head
- NOVA generates a concrete training plan targeting that specific colonist
- Training directives are **persisted to the agent's memory** — they carry forward into every future mission
- Per-agent training logs saved as markdown files in `docs/ld-reports/training/`

### ⚖️ Strike & Reward System
- Issue strikes with a reason — auto-escalates at 3 strikes to Founder inbox
- Grant commendations and promotions — gold glow on tile, reward badge on dossier
- Quality monitoring: every agent response is scored 0–100 by the LLM automatically
- L&D is notified when quality drops below threshold

### 🏢 Hiring Pipeline
- Post-founding hires flow through a recommendation system
- Department managers submit candidates → you approve or reject from the Inbox
- Smart tile assignment: new hires auto-place anywhere in their department zone

## Quick Start

### Option A — Docker (recommended)

> Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). No Node or Python needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BovineDawn/TheColony.git
cd TheColony

# Add your API keys
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env and add at least one key

docker compose up --build
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** → click **Begin** → found your colony.

---

### Option B — Manual Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.12+
- At least one API key: Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google Gemini

#### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BovineDawn/TheColony.git
cd TheColony
```

#### 2. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add at least one key

uvicorn app.main:socket_app --reload --port 8000
# → http://localhost:8000
```

#### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

#### 4. Found Your Colony

Open **http://localhost:5173** → click **Begin** → name your colony → name yourself → approve your 6 founding department heads → the colony map loads.

> **No API keys?** The whole UI works — map, dossiers, hiring, org chart, L&D reports. Agents just won't generate text responses until you add a key.

## How Missions Work

```
You (Founder)
  └─► Sr. Executive (receives mission, writes action plan)
        ├─► Head of Engineering (executes engineering subtask)
        │     └─► Worker agents (if hired)
        ├─► Head of Research (executes research subtask)
        ├─► Head of Writing (drafts deliverables)
        └─► Sr. Executive (compiles final report → returns to Founder)
```

The executive parses which departments are genuinely needed and only dispatches to those — no busy work. Each department manager receives their specific deliverable as a direct task, not a general brief.

Every step streams live in Mission Control. Each agent's response is:
- **Scored 0–100** for quality (auto-flagged if below 50)
- **Memory-compressed** and stored so agents remember past missions
- **Persisted** to SQLite for mission history
- The final compiled report lands in **Founder Inbox** as a formatted mission report card

---

## L&D Autopilot

The L&D head runs a full workforce review cycle automatically:

1. **Triggers on startup** (if not run in the last 24h)
2. **Repeats every 24h** while the server is running
3. For each non-L&D agent, calls the LLM with structured output:
   - `ASSESSMENT:` — one-sentence performance read
   - `TRAINING_NEEDED:` — YES/NO
   - `TRAINING_TOPIC:` — specific topic
   - `SKILL_UPGRADES:` — `skill_name:level` pairs
4. Parses upgrades and applies them to the database
5. Emits real-time Socket.IO events → L&D Activity Overlay on Colony Map updates live
6. Sends a final cycle summary report to the Dashboard

Trigger manually: **Dashboard → RUN CYCLE NOW** or **Colony Map → L&D overlay → RUN NOW**

---

## Design Language

The Colony uses a custom **retro-futuristic authority aesthetic** inspired by Rimworld ID cards:

- **Dark charcoal base** (`hsl(215 22% 6%)`) — not the generic dark navy of every SaaS app
- **Amber accent** (`hsl(42 65% 52%)`) — the tan/beige from physical ID cards, used for titles, active states, and authority elements
- **Cyan tech accent** (`hsl(189 100% 50%)`) — missions, primary actions, AI indicators
- **JetBrains Mono** for all data values — employee IDs, status labels, timestamps
- **Rajdhani** for display headings — THE COLONY, section titles, colony name
- **Grain texture overlay** on the whole app — gives the physical/printed feel
- Agent dossiers include: mugshot frame with height ruler, barcode, reference code, grain texture, department color strip

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Real-time agent-to-agent chat** — watch your agents talk to each other live
- [ ] **Agent personality evolution** — traits shift based on performance over time

- [ ] **Public colony snapshots** — shareable read-only colony views
- [ ] **Export reports as PDF** — generate formal colony status documents
- [ ] **Agent mood system** — color tint on tiles reflects strike count / morale
- [ ] **Custom department creation** — founders can add new departments beyond the defaults
- [ ] **Webhooks** — trigger external systems when missions complete
- [ ] **Mission templates** — save and reuse common mission briefs
- [ ] **Agent-to-agent direct messaging** — sidebar DMs between colonists
